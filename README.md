I. CONCEPT

	This game functions as a learning tool by presenting the player with historical information
	while immersing them in the mind of Julius Caesar. The player is presented with sequential
	prompts and multiple options for each. They then must respond and continue along the path 
	of Caesar's life up to his asassination in 44 BCE without dying. The restart feature
	is built-in since the idea is that upon making a fatal error, the player will then try again
	and learn from their mistakes. Although the historical consequences of choices are presented
	and explained, the immediate score changes are not shown in order to simulate the real-life 
	uncertainty as well as Caesar's risk-taking, dice-throwing modus operandi. 


II. IMPLEMENTATION 

	The game is turn-based and guided by a series of prompts with multiple-choice response. The
	player must select one to move on, and each choice has specific consquences. For some, alternate
	paths are taken; for all, scores are changed. The player's score is a composite of independent
	variables that correspond to things such as favour with Pompey, amount of wealth, and auctoritas. 
	If scores dip below certain thresholds at key parts in the game, Caesar will not be able to 
	continue and die (or fall into ignominy). 


III. HOW TO

	Upon startup, the player is simply presented with an explanatory prompt. To this prompt, and all
	others, the correct method of input is to type a number respresenting your choice and then to press
	enter. For question 14 (the laws), you may type multiple numbers separated by spcaes and then press
	enter. 
	At any time, you may enter 0 to quit.
	You may also enter 5 to show the current scores, or "booty" to have all score changes reported (this
	is a toggle on/off command). Although this feature is provided (primarily for Prof Lisa Mignone), 
	it is not recommended for use during actual gameplay as it weakens the historical mindset of the game.


IV. NOTES

	Historical accuracy is the goal and thus if you do not deviate from actual history, you should win.
	As for alternate paths, these do not represent actual deviations from history, but rather a player's
	emphasis on certain parts of Caesar's life. 

	A GUI version that can be embeded in a webpage is expected to be released in early 2015.
